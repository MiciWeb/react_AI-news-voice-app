# Goal of the project
The main goal of the project is to build an project which display news with our voice recording by using 2 api together, one for the news and the other for the voice record.

## How i build this project
* I was searching an cool API to try it and i found [Alan AI](https://alan.app/) It's an api which provides an voice assistant that you can include in your app.
* With Alan AI i used an another api the official [news api](https://newsapi.org/) to get world daily news from many differents sources.

* I combined thoses both API together to create an voice assistant which can display the news you pronounce, i did it first via the project management of the Alan AI website (here an [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiciWeb/react_AI-news-voice-app/master/src/images/alanScreen.png)) where you can write the directive of the voice assistant, for example telling him what to answer or fetching the data of an other api when an user ask a specific question.

* For the design I learned and used the [material UI](https://material-ui.com/) react library which looks similar to [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  framework developed by Twitter, personnaly I prefer material UI due of a most creative and natural aspect.

* I made the design of the app with my favourite graphic editor [Figma](https://www.figma.com), here is a [screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiciWeb/react_AI-news-voice-app/master/src/images/figmaScreen.png) of the mockup of the project. 

## What is missing in this project
* I would have liked to add an functionnality where the voice assistant can read the title of the news but for a question of time i decided to let it.

## Launch the project
