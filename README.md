# Goal of the project
The main goal of the project is to build an project which display news by using 2 api together.

## How i build this project
* I was searching an cool api to try it and i find [Alan AI](https://alan.app/) It's an api which provides an voice assistant that you can include in your app
* With Alan AI i used an another api wich is the official [news api](https://newsapi.org/) to display daily news to the user
* I combined thoses api together to create an voice assistant which can display the news you say, i did it first via the [project management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiciWeb/react_AI-news-voice-app/master/src/images/alanScreen.png) of the Alan AI website where you can write the directive of the voice assistant for example telling him what to answer when an user ask a specific questions or fetching data from an other api and send it to your code 

* I made the design of the app with my favourite graphics editor [Figma](https://www.figma.com) which I used for a long time since october 2020, here is a [screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiciWeb/react_AI-news-voice-app/master/src/images/figmaScreen.png) of my model on figma 

## What is missing in this project
* I would have liked to add an functionnality where the voice assistant can read the title of the news but it's would be first working only with the primary page of news displaying and to find an way to do it with the other pages would take too much time so i decided to let it.

## Launch the project
* You can take a look on the project [here](https://miciweb.github.io/).
* Or clone the repository and launch it with the cli command "npm start" (be sure to install the required dependencies with "npm install").
